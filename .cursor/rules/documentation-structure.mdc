# Documentation Structure and Standards

## Overview
The `/docs` folder contains comprehensive documentation for the GameHub project, organized into logical sections for different types of documentation and audiences.

## Documentation Structure

### `/docs/plans/` - Implementation Plans ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
**Purpose**: Markdown files containing implementation plans, project roadmaps, and phased work breakdowns.

**Key Requirements**:
- ‚úÖ **MUST contain checklists and phased work breakdowns**
- ‚úÖ **MUST include progress tracking and status indicators**
- ‚úÖ **MUST outline prerequisites and dependencies**
- ‚úÖ **MUST NOT contain source code or implementation details**
- ‚úÖ **MUST focus on planning, coordination, and project management**

**Content Guidelines**:
- Use checkboxes (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`) for task tracking
- Include phase-by-phase breakdowns with clear objectives
- Document prerequisites and system requirements
- Track completion status with visual indicators (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üîÑ)
- Include progress summaries and current status
- Focus on "what" and "when" rather than "how"

**Example Structure**:
```markdown

### `/docs/setup/` - Setup and Configuration
**Purpose**: Detailed setup instructions and configuration documentation.

**Content Types**:

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use UPPERCASE with underscores for plan files: `PROJECT_NAME_PLAN.md`
- Use lowercase with hyphens for guides: `getting-started-guide.md`
- Use descriptive, clear names that indicate content type

### Markdown Formatting
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, etc.)
- Include table of contents for longer documents
- Use code blocks with language specification
- Include links to related documentation
- Use badges and status indicators for progress tracking

### Content Organization
- Start with an overview or summary
- Include prerequisites when applicable
- Break complex topics into logical sections
- Include examples and code snippets where helpful
- End with next steps or related resources

### Version Control
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Update plans as phases are completed
- Maintain accurate status indicators
- Archive completed plans rather than deleting them

## Plan File Template

## Important Notes

1. **Plans vs Implementation**: Plans in `/docs/plans/` should focus on project management, coordination, and tracking. Implementation details belong in code comments, architecture docs, or getting-started guides.

2. **Status Tracking**: Always maintain accurate status indicators and progress summaries in plan files.

3. **Cross-References**: Plans should reference related documentation but not duplicate implementation details.

4. **Maintenance**: Update plan files as work progresses and phases are completed.

5. **Clarity**: Plans should be clear enough for team members to understand what needs to be done and track progress effectively.
