# Jinaga Development Workflow

## Critical Workflow Steps

### 1. Model Changes Require Rebuilding
**ALWAYS rebuild the model after making changes:**
```bash
cd app/gamehub-model
npm run build
```

**Why this matters:**
- Distribution rules, authorization rules, and model changes are not applied until rebuilt
- Tests will fail with outdated rules even if source code is correct
- The `@model` import in dependent projects uses the compiled output, not source

### 2. Development Cycle
```bash
# 1. Make changes to model files
# 2. Rebuild the model
cd app/gamehub-model && npm run build
# 3. Test changes
cd ../gamehub-player && npm test
# 4. Repeat if needed
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Forgetting to Rebuild the Model
**Symptom:** Tests fail with old error messages even after "fixing" the code
**Solution:** Always run `npm run build` in `app/gamehub-model` after changes
