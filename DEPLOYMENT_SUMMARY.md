### 4. Integration with Existing Services
- **Created Docker Compose configuration** (`mesh/docker-compose.yml`):
  - Service-ip service definition
  - Proper network configuration (`gamehub-network`)
  - Volume mounting for secrets directory
  - Health checks and restart policies
  - Environment variable configuration

- **Network and Service Discovery**:
  - Connected to `gamehub-network` for inter-service communication
  - Exposed on port 8083 for external access
  - Ready for integration with other GameHub services

### 5. Validation and Testing
- **Health Endpoint** (`/health`):
  - Added health check endpoint to routes
  - Docker health check configuration
  - Service status monitoring

- **Client Credentials Setup**:
  - Created test client credentials (`mesh/secrets/service-ip/clients/test-client`)
  - Proper file format (filename = client_id, content = client_secret)
  - Volume mounting for secrets directory

- **Comprehensive Testing**:
  - ✅ Docker container builds successfully
  - ✅ Service starts correctly in Docker
  - ✅ Client credentials are accessible from container
  - ✅ OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow works correctly
  - ✅ Health checks pass
  - ✅ Invalid credentials are properly rejected

### 6. CI/CD Configuration
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/service-ip-ci.yml`):
  - Automated testing on push/PR
  - Docker image building and publishing
  - Integration testing with Docker Compose
  - Deployment pipelines for staging and production

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Development
```bash
# Build service locally
./scripts/build-service-ip.sh

# Run service locally
cd app/service-ip && npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with Docker Compose
./scripts/deploy-mesh.sh

# Test deployment
./scripts/test-service-ip.sh

# View logs
cd mesh && docker-compose logs -f service-ip

# Stop services
cd mesh && docker-compose down
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t gamehub/service-ip:latest app/service-ip

# Run container manually
docker run -p 8083:8083 \
  -v $(pwd)/mesh/secrets/service-ip/clients:/app/secrets/clients:ro \
  gamehub/service-ip:latest
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)
- `SERVER_PORT` - Service port (default: 8083)
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret (change in production!)
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` - Token expiration (default: 1h)
- `CLIENTS_DIR` - Client credentials directory path

### Client Credentials Format
- **File location**: `mesh/secrets/service-ip/clients/`
- **File naming**: Filename = client_id (no extension)
- **File content**: Plain text client_secret
- **Example**: File `test-client` contains `test-secret-123`

### Network Configuration
- **Service Port**: 8083
- **Docker Network**: `gamehub-network`
- **Health Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8083/health`
- **Token Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8083/token`

## 🔒 Security Features

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution (`service-ip:1001`)
- Read-only volume mounts for secrets
- Minimal Alpine Linux base image
- Proper file permissions and ownership

### Application Security
- Client ID sanitization (path traversal prevention)
- Secure JWT token generation
- Environment-based configuration
- Input validation and error handling

### Production Considerations
- Change default JWT_SECRET
- Use secure client credentials
- Regular secret rotation
- Monitor health endpoints
- Log aggregation and monitoring

## 🧪 Testing

The deployment includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Health Check**: Service availability and responsiveness
2. **Valid Credentials**: OAuth 2.0 token generation
3. **Invalid Credentials**: Proper error handling
4. **JWT Structure**: Token format validation
5. **Integration**: End-to-end workflow testing

All tests pass successfully, confirming the service is ready for production deployment.

## 📚 Documentation

- **Deployment Guide**: `mesh/README.md`
- **Service Documentation**: `app/service-ip/README.md`
- **Integration Plan**: `SERVICE_IP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`

## 🎯 Next Steps

The service-ip is now fully integrated and ready for:

1. **Production Deployment**: Use the provided scripts and configurations
2. **Service Integration**: Connect other GameHub services using the OAuth 2.0 flow
3. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and metrics collection
4. **Scaling**: Add load balancing and multiple instances as needed
5. **Security**: Implement additional security measures for production

The deployment configuration ensures service-ip works seamlessly within the existing Docker orchestration setup while maintaining compatibility with the monorepo structure.
