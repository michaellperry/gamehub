# Getting Started with GameHub

Welcome to the GameHub platform - a comprehensive collaborative multiplayer game management system built with modern web technologies including React, Jinaga, and Docker orchestration.

## Overview

GameHub is a full-stack application designed to manage multiplayer gaming sessions and collaborative gameplay experiences. The platform consists of multiple interconnected services including player interfaces, administrative dashboards, and backend services, all orchestrated through Docker Compose.

## Architecture

The platform is built using:
- **Frontend**: React applications with Vite build system
- **Data Layer**: Jinaga for distributed data management
- **Backend**: Node.js services with Express
- **Authentication**: OAuth-based authentication system
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for service management
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines

## Quick Start
