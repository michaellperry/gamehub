- [ ] Development-only activation works properly
- [ ] No global service state management
- [ ] Minimal memory footprint and complexity
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage with real Jinaga instances
- [ ] All integration points updated and working

## Technical Approach

### Jinaga Reactive Integration
- Use `j.watch` with playground specifications for real-time monitoring
- Leverage existing fact types (User, Player, Join, PlayerName)
- Rely on Jinaga's built-in error handling and reconnection
- Use reactive patterns instead of manual state management

### Simplified Architecture
- **Single Hook**: `useSimplifiedPlayerSession` replaces complex service
- **Reactive Monitoring**: Jinaga `j.watch` handles playground detection
- **Minimal State**: Only track basic counts for UI feedback
- **Development Only**: Automatic activation in development mode
- **No Global State**: Eliminate complex service instance management

### Player Creation Flow
1. **Playground Detection**: `j.watch` detects new playground in tenant
2. **Random Delay**: Generate delay between 1-5 seconds
3. **Player Creation**: Create User → Player → Join → PlayerName facts
4. **Name Generation**: Use existing `gamingNames.ts` utility
5. **No Tracking**: Each name generated independently, no duplicate checking

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead with efficient Jinaga specifications
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup in useEffect return functions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of Jinaga connection issues
- **Development Only**: Clear activation only in development mode
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests with real Jinaga instances

## Notes

### Key Benefits of Simplified Approach
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates complex service architecture
2. **Reactive Patterns**: Uses Jinaga's built-in reactive capabilities
3. **Minimal State**: Only tracks essential counts for UI
4. **No Global Services**: Eliminates complex instance management
5. **Development Focus**: Clear separation for development-only features

### Integration Points
- **Main App**: Simplified provider integration
- **Home Page**: Reactive playground monitoring
- **Testing**: Real Jinaga instances with full model
- **Configuration**: Minimal environment variables
- **Documentation**: Clear implementation guides

### Future Considerations
- **Production Mode**: Could be extended for production use cases
- **Configuration**: Could add more granular control options
- **Monitoring**: Could add basic metrics for debugging
- **Multi-tenant**: Could support multiple tenant monitoring
