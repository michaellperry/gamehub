# Challenge Flow Implementation Plan (Simplified)

## Overview
This plan implements the challenge flow as described in the Playground PRD, where players can issue challenges to other players in a playground, and opponents can accept (creating a Game) or reject the challenge.

## Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Jinaga model structure is stable and accessible
- ‚úÖ React component patterns are established

## Notes
- This plan follows the recommended Jinaga implementation order to ensure each step builds upon the previous
- UI design will reveal the exact data requirements for the challenge flow
- Custom hooks will identify the specific queries and commands needed
- Authorization and distribution rules will be based on actual user workflows
- Testing will validate that the entire system works together
- Real-time updates are critical for good user experience
- Game creation should be atomic with challenge acceptance
- UI should provide clear feedback for all challenge states
- Error handling should guide users to correct actions
- Performance considerations for multiple concurrent challenges
- Accessibility requirements for challenge flow interactions
