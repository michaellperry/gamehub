# Background Service Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a background service within the browser that uses Jinaga's `j.watch` feature to automatically manage a set of three players. The service will monitor for new playgrounds in the tenant and automatically join them after a short delay.

## Progress Summary
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Research and Design** - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Core Service Implementation** - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3: Testing Framework** - COMPLETED
- üîÑ **Phase 4: Player Management** - IN PROGRESS
- ‚ùå **Phase 5: Integration and Testing** - PENDING
- ‚ùå **Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring** - PENDING

**Current Status**: Auto-Join Coordinator implementation complete with comprehensive test coverage - join timing coordination, conflict resolution, leave logic, and success/failure tracking all implemented and tested with real Jinaga instances

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Test Requirements for All Phases**:
- Each phase MUST include comprehensive unit tests
- Tests should avoid mocks, favoring integration testing among production components
- Use real Jinaga instances with full model integration for testing
- Test authorization and distribution rules with actual fact types
- Validate real-time behavior using `j.watch` with actual observers
- Ensure test isolation using memory stores and proper cleanup

## Prerequisites
- [x] Jinaga watch feature documentation and examples
- [x] Understanding of current playground join flow
- [x] React hook patterns for service lifecycle management
- [x] Player authentication and session management
- [x] Tenant isolation and security considerations

**Key Findings**:
- `j.watch` returns an `Observer<T>` object with `cached()`, `loaded()`, and `stop()` methods
- Asynchronous callbacks can return promises for background processing
- For React apps, `useSpecification` hook is preferred over direct `j.watch`
- Observable collections support `onAdded()` callbacks for sub-specifications

**Unit Tests**:
- [x] Test service component interactions with real Jinaga instances
- [x] Validate service lifecycle with actual playground monitoring
- [x] Test error handling with real network failures and reconnections
- [x] Verify component integration without mocking dependencies

### 1.3 Data Model Integration

## Technical Approach

### Jinaga Real-time Integration
- Use Jinaga's `j.watch` with async callbacks for background processing
- Leverage `useSpecification` hooks for React UI updates
- Implement proper observer lifecycle management with `stop()` method
- Use Jinaga's built-in error recovery and reconnection mechanisms

### Service Architecture
- **BackgroundServiceManager**: Pure service class with no React dependencies
- **usePlayerPool**: React hook for player pool lifecycle management
- **useBackgroundService**: React hook for service lifecycle management
- **AutoJoinCoordinator**: Background processing with async callbacks

### Data Model Integration
- **User**: Use existing `User` facts for background user accounts
- **Player**: Use existing `Player` facts for background players (linked to users)
- Use existing `Join` fact type for auto-join tracking
- Leverage existing authorization and distribution rules

## Success Criteria
- [x] Background service successfully monitors for new playgrounds using `j.watch`
- [x] Three background players (using existing `User` and `Player` facts) automatically join playgrounds after configurable delay
- [x] Service handles concurrent playground creation without conflicts (Jinaga built-in)
- [x] Service recovers from errors and network issues (Jinaga built-in)
- [x] Performance impact on main application is minimal
- [x] Service can be enabled/disabled via environment variables
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage with 307 lines of test code
- [x] Jinaga testing utilities and strategy documentation
- [ ] Background players rotate and maintain active sessions
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and logging is in place
- [ ] All phases include comprehensive unit tests with real component integration
- [ ] Tests avoid mocks in favor of testing actual production component interactions

## Risk Mitigation
- [ ] **Concurrency Issues**: Use Jinaga's built-in fact ordering and conflict resolution
- [ ] **Network Failures**: Leverage Jinaga's automatic reconnection and retry mechanisms
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Use efficient watch patterns and proper observer cleanup
- [ ] **Security Concerns**: Use existing tenant isolation and authorization rules
- [ ] **Resource Leaks**: Implement proper observer cleanup in React useEffect cleanup functions
