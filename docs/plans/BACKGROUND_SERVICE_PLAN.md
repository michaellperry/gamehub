# Background Service Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a background service within the browser that uses Jinaga's `watch` feature to automatically manage a set of three players. The service will monitor for new playgrounds in the tenant and automatically join them after a short delay.

## Technical Approach

### Jinaga Real-time Integration
- Use Jinaga's specification patterns for monitoring playground creation
- Leverage existing `useSpecification` patterns from React components
- Implement background monitoring using direct Jinaga client queries
- Ensure proper tenant isolation and authorization

### Service Architecture
- **BackgroundServiceManager**: Main service coordinator
- **PlayerPoolManager**: Manages the three-player pool
- **PlaygroundMonitor**: Monitors for new playgrounds in tenant
- **AutoJoinCoordinator**: Handles timing and coordination of joins

### Data Model Extensions
- **PlayerPool**: Fact type for managing background player pools
- **PoolPlayer**: Fact type for individual players in the pool
- **AutoJoin**: Fact type for tracking automatic joins (extends existing Join pattern)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Background service successfully monitors for new playgrounds
- [ ] Three players automatically join playgrounds after configurable delay
- [ ] Service handles concurrent playground creation without conflicts
- [ ] Players rotate and maintain active sessions
- [ ] Service recovers from errors and network issues
- [ ] Performance impact on main application is minimal
- [ ] Service can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and logging is in place

## Risk Mitigation
- [ ] **Concurrency Issues**: Implement proper locking and coordination
- [ ] **Network Failures**: Add retry logic and reconnection handling
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Use efficient watch patterns and limit concurrent operations
- [ ] **Security Concerns**: Ensure proper tenant isolation and authorization
- [ ] **Resource Leaks**: Implement proper cleanup and resource management

## Notes

### Research Priorities
1. **Jinaga Watch API**: Need to research the exact API for watching facts
2. **Real-time Patterns**: Understand best practices for real-time fact monitoring
3. **Performance Considerations**: Ensure watch patterns don't impact main app performance
4. **Security Model**: Verify authorization rules work with background service

### Integration Points
- **Main App**: Service should integrate seamlessly with existing player app
- **Admin Interface**: Add controls for managing background service
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with existing status dashboard
- **Configuration**: Use existing environment variable patterns

### Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Pool Sizing**: Allow runtime configuration of player pool size
- **Smart Join Timing**: Implement more sophisticated join timing algorithms
- **Player Behavior Simulation**: Add realistic player behavior patterns
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Extend to support multiple tenants simultaneously
