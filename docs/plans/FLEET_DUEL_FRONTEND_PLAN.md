# Fleet Duel Front End Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the Fleet Duel front end, specifically focusing on the ship placement phase. The implementation will refactor the current game page to separate Tic-tac-toe gameplay from Fleet Duel, creating a modular game interface system.

- [ ] All drag and drop interactions work smoothly
- [ ] Validation feedback is clear and immediate
- [ ] Game type detection works reliably
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Technical Notes

### Component Architecture
- Use atomic design principles (atoms ‚Üí molecules ‚Üí organisms)
- Maintain separation of concerns between game logic and UI
- Ensure reusable components for future game types
- Follow existing component patterns and styling

### State Management
- Use React hooks for local state management
- Maintain game state consistency with existing patterns
- Ensure real-time updates work with Jinaga
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize drag and drop performance
- Minimize re-renders during ship placement
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide screen reader support
- Maintain color contrast requirements
- Support assistive technologies

## Notes
- This plan focuses only on the front end implementation
- No changes to Jinaga model are included
- Ship placement phase is the primary focus
- Attack phase and end game are noted for future implementation
- All existing Tic-tac-toe functionality must be preserved
- The plan assumes game type detection will be implemented in the backend
