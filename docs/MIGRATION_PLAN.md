# Ideal Order of Operations for GameHub Migration

Based on my analysis of the GameHub architecture and dependencies, here's the optimal migration sequence that minimizes risk and ensures each component has its dependencies ready:

## ✅ Completed Infrastructure

### Project Foundation
- [x] **Comprehensive .gitignore** - Created with proper exclusions for Node.js, TypeScript, IDEs, OS files, and project-specific patterns
- [x] **Project structure** - Base directory structure is established and ready for development

### Phase 1.3 - Shared Data Model (COMPLETE)
- [x] **gamehub-model package** - Complete npm package with dual build system (ESM + CJS)
- [x] **Domain transformation** - Successfully transformed LaunchKings domain model to GameHub
- [x] **Core Jinaga facts** - User, Tenant, GameSession, Player, and all supporting facts
- [x] **Authorization system** - Comprehensive rules for tenant and game session access control
- [x] **Distribution system** - Proper data distribution rules for multi-tenant architecture
- [x] **TypeScript configuration** - Multiple build targets with proper type generation

### Phase 1.2 - Environment Configuration (PARTIAL)
- [x] **Secrets directory structure** - [`mesh/secrets/shared/`](mesh/secrets/shared/) established
- [x] **Service communication foundation** - Initial setup for shared secrets (in progress)

## Phase 1: Foundation and Dependencies (Days 1-3)
**Critical Path**: These components have no dependencies and are required by everything else

### 1.1 Project Structure Setup
```bash
# Create the complete directory structure first
mkdir -p {app,mesh,scripts,data,http,notebooks,screenshots}
mkdir -p app/{gamehub-model,gamehub-admin,gamehub-player,service-ip,player-ip,content-store,load-test}
mkdir -p mesh/{nginx,front-end,secrets}
mkdir -p scripts/{setup,deployment}
```

### 1.2 Environment Configuration
- [x] Set up [`mesh/secrets/`](mesh/secrets/) directory structure
- [x] Generate shared secrets for service-to-service communication (started)
- [x] Create base environment files (started)

### 1.3 Shared Data Model ([`app/gamehub-model/`](app/gamehub-model/))
**Priority: HIGHEST** - Everything depends on this
- [x] Create the npm package structure with dual build (ESM + CJS)
- [x] Define core Jinaga facts (User, Tenant, GameSession, Player)
- [x] Implement authorization rules
- [x] Implement distribution rules
- [x] Set up policy generation scripts

**Why First**: All services and applications depend on this shared model. Without it, nothing else can be properly typed or function.
