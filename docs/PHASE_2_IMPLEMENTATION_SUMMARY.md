# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: Relay Service for Centralized Observability

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the status and setup pages system by creating the Relay Service - a centralized observability aggregation service that monitors all GameHub services and provides unified status information.

## Implementation Details

### Service Architecture

The Relay Service is built as a robust Node.js/TypeScript microservice with the following key components:

- **Express.js Server**: RESTful API with comprehensive middleware
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time status updates for connected clients
- **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based service discovery and monitoring
- **Caching Layer**: 30-second cache to prevent backend service overload
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- **Security**: Helmet security headers, CORS configuration, input validation

```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Configuration-Driven Service Discovery
- JSON configuration via `RELAY_CONFIG` environment variable
- Default configuration for all GameHub services
- Configurable timeouts, retries, and polling intervals
- Support for both services and bundles (future admin portal integration)

#### 2. Parallel Health Checks
- Simultaneous monitoring of `/health`, `/configured`, and `/ready` endpoints
- Exponential backoff retry logic with configurable attempts
- 5-second timeout per service with graceful error handling
- Response time tracking for performance monitoring

#### 3. Unified Response Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:30:15.123Z",
  "services": {
    "service-ip": {
      "health": true,
      "configured": true,
      "configuredGroups": {
        "jwt": true,
        "clients": ["player-ip"]
      },
      "ready": true,
      "lastChecked": "2025-01-09T15:30:14.890Z",
      "responseTime": 45
    }
  },
  "summary": {
    "totalServices": 3,
    "healthyServices": 3,
    "configuredServices": 2,
    "readyServices": 2,
    "overallStatus": "healthy"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Real-Time WebSocket Updates
- WebSocket server at `/ws` endpoint
- Automatic connection management and cleanup
- Periodic status broadcasts every 10 seconds
- Initial status sent on connection establishment
- Ping/pong heartbeat for connection health

#### 5. Comprehensive API Endpoints

- **GET /relay**: Main aggregated status endpoint
- **GET /relay/health**: Service health check
- **POST /relay/refresh**: Force cache refresh and broadcast update
- **GET /relay/cache/stats**: Cache statistics for debugging
- **WebSocket /relay/ws**: Real-time status updates

#### 6. Advanced Caching Strategy
- 30-second cache timeout (configurable)
- Cache statistics tracking
- Manual cache invalidation support
- Prevents overwhelming backend services

### Integration Components

#### 1. Docker Integration
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Optimized build with separate builder and production stages
- **Security**: Non-root user execution
- **Health Checks**: Built-in Docker health check
- **Production Ready**: Proper signal handling and graceful shutdown

#### 2. Docker Compose Integration
```yaml
relay-service:
  build:
    context: ../app/relay-service
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  container_name: gamehub-relay-service
  ports:
    - "8084:8084"
  environment:
    - NODE_ENV=production
    - SERVER_PORT=8084
    - RELAY_CONFIG=${RELAY_CONFIG:-}
  networks:
    - gamehub-network
  restart: unless-stopped
```

#### 3. NGINX Routing Configuration
```nginx
# Relay Service (observability aggregation)
location /relay {
    proxy_pass http://gamehub-relay-service:8084/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    
    # WebSocket support for real-time updates
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    
    # Timeout settings for WebSocket connections
    proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    proxy_send_timeout 86400;
}
```

#### 4. Environment Configuration
Added to `mesh/.env.example`:
```bash
# Relay Service Configuration
RELAY_CORS_ORIGIN=*
RELAY_CACHE_TIMEOUT=30000
RELAY_CONFIG={"services":{"service-ip":{"name":"Service IP","healthEndpoint":"http://service-ip:8083/health","configuredEndpoint":"http://service-ip:8083/configured","readyEndpoint":"http://service-ip:8083/ready"},"player-ip":{"name":"Player IP","healthEndpoint":"http://player-ip:8082/health","configuredEndpoint":"http://player-ip:8082/configured","readyEndpoint":"http://player-ip:8082/ready"},"content-store":{"name":"Content Store","healthEndpoint":"http://content-store:8081/health","configuredEndpoint":"http://content-store:8081/configured","readyEndpoint":"http://content-store:8081/ready"}},"polling":{"interval":10000,"timeout":30000}}
