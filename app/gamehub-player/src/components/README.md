# GameHub Player Design System

This directory contains the components and styles that make up the GameHub Player design system. The design system is organized using the Atomic Design methodology, which helps create consistent, reusable, and maintainable UI components specifically tailored for the player-facing application.

## Structure

The design system is organized into the following directories:

- **atoms/**: Basic building blocks of the UI, such as buttons, icons, and form inputs.
- **molecules/**: Combinations of atoms that form more complex UI components, such as modals and forms.
- **organisms/**: Complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms that form a distinct section of the interface.
- **styles/**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS customizations.

## Player App Design Philosophy

The player app design system emphasizes:

1. **Gaming-Focused UX**: Components designed for gaming contexts with clear visual hierarchy
2. **Real-time Interactions**: Optimized for live game sessions and real-time updates
3. **Accessibility**: Ensuring all players can participate regardless of abilities
4. **Performance**: Lightweight components for smooth gaming experiences
5. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for various screen sizes

## Usage

### Importing Components

Components can be imported from their respective directories:

```jsx
// Import atomic components
import { Button, Card, Icon, Alert } from './components/atoms';

// Import molecular components
import { GameCard, PlayerAvatar } from './components/molecules';

// Import organism components
import { GameSession, PlayerList } from './components/organisms';
```

### Style Guide

A comprehensive style guide is available at `/style-guide` in the application. This page showcases all available components, their variants, and usage examples.

## Component Categories

### Atoms

## Design Principles

1. **Gaming-Centric**: Components designed specifically for gaming contexts
2. **Real-time Ready**: Optimized for live updates and real-time interactions
3. **Accessibility**: Ensuring all players can participate regardless of abilities
4. **Performance**: Lightweight components for smooth gaming experiences
5. **Responsiveness**: Works well on all screen sizes from mobile to desktop

## Tailwind CSS

The design system is built on top of Tailwind CSS with gaming-specific customizations. Custom theme extensions are defined in `tailwind.config.js`.

### Custom Tailwind Classes

Custom component classes are defined using the `@layer components` directive in `src/index.css`. These classes provide consistent styling for gaming UI patterns.

Example:

```css
@layer components {
    .btn-game-primary {
        @apply bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white font-medium py-3 px-6 rounded-lg transition-all duration-200 transform hover:scale-105;
    }
    
    .game-card {
        @apply bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-gray-200 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow duration-200;
    }
}
```

## Color System

The player app color system is optimized for gaming contexts:

- **Primary**: Used for primary actions and game highlights
- **Secondary**: Used for secondary actions and UI elements
- **Success**: Used for positive game events and achievements
- **Warning**: Used for game warnings and alerts
- **Error**: Used for errors and critical game events
- **Neutral**: Used for text, backgrounds, and borders

## Typography

Typography is standardized using Tailwind's typography classes with gaming-optimized sizing:

- **Game Title**: `text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900`
- **Section Headers**: `text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900`
- **Card Titles**: `text-lg font-medium text-gray-900`
- **Body Text**: `text-base text-gray-700`
- **Game Text**: `text-sm text-gray-600`
- **Status Text**: `text-xs text-gray-500`

## Gaming-Specific Components

### Game Status Indicators

- **Online/Offline**: Real-time player status
- **In Game**: Active game session indicators
- **Ready/Not Ready**: Player readiness status
- **Spectator Mode**: View-only game access

### Real-time Features

- **Live Updates**: Components that update in real-time
- **Typing Indicators**: Chat typing indicators
- **Game Events**: Real-time game event notifications
- **Player Actions**: Live player action displays

## Adding New Components

When adding new components to the design system:

1. Place the component in the appropriate directory based on its complexity (atom, molecule, organism).
2. Export the component from the directory's `index.ts` file.
3. Add the component to the style guide page.
4. Document the component's props and usage.
5. Ensure the component follows gaming UX best practices.

## Icons

Icons are managed through the `Icon` component, which provides a consistent API for all icons in the application. Gaming-specific icons include:

- Game controls (play, pause, stop)
- Player actions (join, leave, ready)
- Game states (waiting, active, finished)
- Social features (chat, friends, notifications)

## Contributing

When contributing to the design system:

1. Follow the existing patterns and conventions.
2. Consider gaming-specific UX requirements.
3. Ensure components work well in real-time contexts.
4. Update the style guide with any new components or changes.
5. Ensure components are accessible and responsive.
6. Document props and usage with gaming examples.

## Performance Considerations

- Use lightweight SVG icons
- Optimize for real-time updates
- Minimize re-renders in game contexts
- Use efficient state management for live data
- Consider mobile performance constraints
